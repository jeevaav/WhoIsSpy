# Who is Spy?

Android social game application to be played during social events with your friends and family.


### Rough idea on how to play

There will be two closely related words chosen the computer. One is a normal word and another one is a spy word.
Each players will be given either one of these words. Of course, the spy word will be given to the lesser number 
players. Then, each player describes the word given in turn. The first person to start explaining will be determined
by the computer for you. After each round of explanation, you will discuss among others to kill a person whom all 
of you agree is a spy. The game continues until all the spies are killed or number of spies become similar to number 
of normal players.
